-- | A Database interface for storing various things in a DB. In practice,
-- we'll need some extra contraints on the wallet state that allows us to
-- serialize and unserialize it (e.g. @forall s. (Serialize s) => ...@)
--
-- NOTE:
--
-- We can't use record accessors on the DBLayer as it carries an existential
-- within its constructor. We are forced to pattern-match on the `DBLayer`
-- record type in order to be able to use its methods in any context. With
-- NamedFieldPuns, or RecordWildCards, this can be quite easy:
--
-- @
-- myFunction DBLayer{..} = do
--     ...
--
-- myOtherFunction DBLayer{atomically,initializeWallet} = do
--     ...
-- @
--
-- Alternatively, in some other context where the database may not be a function
-- argument but come from a different source, it is possible to simply rely on
-- 'Data.Function.(&)' to easily pattern match on it:
--
-- @
-- myFunction arg0 arg1 = db & \DBLayer{..} -> do
--     ...
--   where
--     db = ...
-- @
--
-- Note that it isn't possible to simply use a @where@ clause or a @let@ binding
-- here as the semantic for those are slightly different: we really need a
-- pattern match here!

-- So, as we insert checkpoints, we make sure to:
--
-- - Prune any checkpoint that more than `k` blocks in the past
-- - Keep only one checkpoint every 100 blocks
-- - But still keep ~10 most recent checkpoints to cope with small rollbacks
