# Basic definitions

*   **Collateral inputs**, in a transaction, are used to cover transaction fees
    in the case that a non-native script fails. The term **collateral** refers
    to the total ada contained in the UTxOs referenced by collateral inputs.
    Collateral inputs can **only** contain ada: they may **not** contain
    non-ada assets.

*   The protocol parameter `collateralPercent` is used to specify the
    percentage of the total transaction fee its collateral must (at a minimum)
    cover. The collateral inputs must not themselves be locked by a script.

*   The protocol parameter `maxCollateralInputs` is used to limit,
    additionally, the total number of collateral inputs, and thus the total
    number of additional signatures that must be checked during validation.

# Proposed requirements

1.  The wallet, when requested to create a transaction requiring collateral,
    should reserve one or more pure-ada UTxO entries to serve as collateral
    inputs, where the total balance of collateral inputs is greater than or
    equal to the minimum required, as determined by the `collateralPercent`
    protocol parameter and the transaction fee.

2.  The wallet, when requested to create a transaction requiring collateral,
    should fail with an error if the total balance of pure-ada UTxO entries is
    insufficient to cover the minimum collateral amount, as determined by the
    `collateralPercent` protocol parameter and the transaction fee.

3.  The wallet's create transaction operation should accept a parameter
    `collateralPercentMaximum`, with a default value that can be overridden
    by the caller. The wallet, when requested to create a transaction requiring
    collateral, should fail with an error if it **is** possible to meet the
    minimum amount, but **not** possible to find a set of pure-ada entries
    whose total balance is less than or equal to
    `collateralPercentMaximum Ã— transactionFee`.

4.  The wallet should ensure that any UTxO entries used for collateral are
    **locked** until the transactions that include them are validated.

5.  The wallet should report the balance of posted collateral entries as part
    of the total balance, but not as part of the available balance.

# Potential issues that might affect users

## Lack of collateral

In general, a wallet's UTxO set is **not** guaranteed to have entries that are
suitable for use as collateral inputs. For example, it's quite possible that
**all** of a wallet's ada is bundled together with other non-ada assets.

There are several ways this might occur naturally:

1.  If the user frequently makes payments with non-ada assets, then the coin
    selection algorithm will frequently create change outputs that bundle ada
    together with non-ada assets. Over time, the UTxO distribution of their
    wallet may evolve to a state where all ada is bundled together with non-ada
    assets.

2.  If the user migrates a wallet with non-ada assets, these assets will be
    bundled together with ada in the resulting wallet. Indeed, the migration
    algorithm is designed to coalesce bundles together as much as possible, in
    order to:

    a. minimize the number of transactions required to perform a migration;
    b. minimize the overall fee required; and
    c. maximize the proportion of a UTxO set that can be successfully migrated.

## Excessive collateral

The distribution of a wallet's UTxO set may be such that all the pure-ada
entries are far in excess of what would be required for collateral.

In this case, the user might be reluctant to use any of their existing entries
as collateral.

## Potential solutions for these issues

1.  Do nothing in addition to satisfying the requirements above.

    If the user encounters a situation where their wallet's UTxO set does not
    have enough collateral, or where the UTxO set only has pure-ada entries
    that are too large, then they themselves will need to manually create a
    rebalancing transaction that creates the appropriate collateral entries.

2.  Adjust the wallet so that it tries to maintain, over time, a UTxO set that
    has some proportion of entries suitable for inclusion as collateral inputs
    in future transactions. This might involve the following adjustments:

    a.  Adjust the migration algorithm so that it attempts to create a target
        UTxO distribution with at least some entries suitable for use as
        collateral inputs. This would probably require a relatively large
        amount of development and testing effort to achieve, as the migration
        algorithm is currently designed to do the opposite of this.

    b.  Adjust the way we call the standard coin selection algorithm, so that
        if the requested transaction would evolve the UTxO set to a state where
        there are no entries suitable for use as collateral inputs, we
        automatically append one or more additional pure-ada outputs (similar
        to change outputs) to the transaction, to rectify this. This would
        almost certainly add extra complexity to the coin selection algorithm.

3.  On accepting a user request to make a selection that requires collateral:

    a.  If the wallet detects that the UTxO set has **sufficient** collateral,
        then return just one selection, with the outputs the user asked for.

    b.  If the wallet detects that the UTxO set has **insufficient** collateral,
        then return an ordered list with two selections:

        1. Selection 1: a transaction that creates appropriate collateral.
        2. Selection 2: a transaction corresponding to the user request.

    c.  If the wallet detects that the UTxO set has **sufficient** collateral,
        but that it's not possible to satisfy the `collateralPercentMaximum`
        parameter, then return an ordered list with two selections:

        1. Selection 1: a transaction that creates appropriate collateral.
        2. Selection 2: a transaction corresponding to the user request.

    In each of the above cases, the user can inspect the list of selections
    returned, and decide whether or not they want to go ahead (by signing the
    selections, and/or submitting them).

4.  Provide an explicit endpoint that creates a collateral rearrangement
    transaction. This endpoint might have to accept a specific amount.  On
    accepting a user request to make a selection that requires collateral, if
    we detect that the wallet has insufficient collateral, then fail with an
    error that refers them to this endpoint.

# Discussion points

1.  What is the true risk, for an honest user, of losing their collateral? Is
    it possible for bugs in one or more components of the system (e.g., the
    wallet) to result in the loss of the user's collateral, even when the user
    is honest?

2.  Even if we adjust the migration and coin selection algorithms so that they
    maintain, over time, a UTxO set that has some entries suitable for use as
    collateral, it's likely that there still other ways in which a wallet's
    UTxO set can arrive at a state where there are no entries suitable for use
    as collateral. For example, even if we did adjust the migration algorithm
    in the way described above, then a wallet migrated with the old algorithm
    might still be without entries suitable for use as collateral.

# Additional definitions

*   A **rebalancing transaction**: a transaction whose output addresses are all
    owned by the wallet, whose sole purpose is to rebalance the UTxO
    distribution in some way.

*   A **collateral rebalancing transaction**: a transaction that rebalances the
    UTxO distribution so that it has outputs suitable for inclusion as
    collateral inputs in a later transaction. Such a transaction would ensure
    the presence of one or more pure-ada UTxO entries, and could be tailored to
    producing collateral entries of a certain size.
